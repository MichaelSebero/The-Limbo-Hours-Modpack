## Description

This modpack has been a project I've worked on for 6 years and I've finally decided to make it public. I've created the perfect Minecraft experience and I want to share it with everyone. If you enjoy a highly configured and balanced factory/magic modpack which has it's own uniqueness to it, this modpack is for you. I might do some minor tweaking to the pack later but the experience will remain the same as I've originally designed.
